* css selectors for go [[https://travis-ci.org/niklasfasching/css.svg?branch=master]]
Yet another package implementing a css selector compiler for go - see e.g. [[https://github.com/ericchiang/css/][github.com/ericchiang/css]] and [[https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia][github.com/andybalholm/cascadia]] for prior art.

* todo
- escape handling (string/ident)
- investigate right-to-left matching (fb55)
- implement pseudo function selectors
